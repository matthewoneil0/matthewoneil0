## **Hello! Welcome to my GitHub! 👋**

![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=matthewoneil0)

I am a SOC Analyst in the United States. This is my personal GitHub and in no way related to my professional services. 
This page is more for personal projects, forks of cool code, and whatever else.

My activity on any and all of these platforms varies depending on how much time I have to spend on writing, projects, and hacking.
